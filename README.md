### Project Notes

Which option(s) did you complete for the final project? This is so we will know
where to look for your code (Lab 6 repo for Huffman, Lab 7 repo for extensions
to Lab 7, this repo for quadtrees). Please also list any known issues or
limitations of your code (for example, maybe you finished all of Lab 7 and
attempted quadtrees but didn't finish).

I chose option 1: The Lab 7 extension.
